Hello!

The files sut.c and sut_testing.c were created by me (Darcy Mazloum) and demonstrate my ability in simple multi-thread in C.

All other files were given as part of an assignment in a university class. If you are the original owner simply contact me and I will remove them.

This project must be run in a Linux environment due to the use of ucontext.h, a depricated library not found on Windows (based on what I understand).
